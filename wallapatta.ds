### Moving to a git based blog powered by Wallapatta

For long time I wanted to move my blog from <<http://chethiya3000.blogspot.com(blogspot)>> to a git based blog. Since <<http://twitter.com/vpj(@vpj)>> has created some <<http://vpj.github.io/wallapatta.html(boilerplates)>>  based on <<http://vpj.github.io/wallapatta/introduction.html(Wallapatta)>> I thought this is good time to do that.

 Wallapatta is a tree in Sri Lanka.

Wallapatta is a
<<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown(Markdown)>> like syntax that can create documents with layouts
inspired by handouts of Edward R. Tufte^^1^^. We created it to use for documents. The two great things about Wallapatta is that it creates documents with **sidenotes** and **create print frindly documents** - <<http://vpj.github.io/wallapatta/introduction.html(Wallapatta editor)>> creates print layouts with intelligent page breaks by trying not to place breaks at middle of content like most word processing software do.
